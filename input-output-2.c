/*what would be the output of the following program....?

so my program is

#include<stdio.h> 
int main()
{
    float a=3.15529;
    printf("\n%6.2f",a);
    printf("\n%6.3f",a);
    printf("\n%5.4f",a);
    printf("\n%2.1f",a);
    printf("\n%0.0f",a);
return 1;
}

/*
As i told in my previous question 


you can also change the value of 1 to any integer no.

but now,

float a=3.15529
the variable a is declared as an float data type and initalized to value 3.15529

    printf("\n%2.1f",a);
    the specifier tells. 1f tells the printf function to place only one
    number after dot (.)

    






And result in my terminal
