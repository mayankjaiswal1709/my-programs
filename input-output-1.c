-------------------------------------------------input and output-------------------------------------------

good aftnoon to all............ 
respacted sir and all my dear classmates .
i am Mayank jaiswal and 
I am here to disscus some questions about  input and output 
here is my 1st qustion


/*what would be the output of the following program....?
so my program is
*/

#include<stdio.h> 
int main()
{
    int a=250;
    printf("so finally ye humara result he\n");
    printf("%1d",a);
return 0;
}




/*
int a=250;
the variable  a  is declared as an integer type  and inirialized to value 250.

printf("%1d",   a   );
it print the value of variable  a.



so finally our output of program is in terminal 


 % ke badd 1 q use kiya he
so 1 indicates space 
before printing result it take one space and print the value

you can also changee the value of 1 to any integer no. 




..................S-I-M-I-L-A-R-L-Y.........
now i proceed for my next question
